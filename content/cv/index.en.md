## 🧠 Summary

I help companies build reliable, maintainable systems — from fast-delivered MVPs to long-term, efficient platforms.  
With 20+ years in software development, I work closely with teams to deliver clean, performance-focused solutions using Python, SQL, and modern async backend frameworks like FastAPI.  
I work 100% remotely and adapt to each project’s context — whether you need quick wins or ongoing backend expertise.
