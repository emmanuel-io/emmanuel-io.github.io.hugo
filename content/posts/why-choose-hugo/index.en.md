As a backend developer focused on optimization and long-term value, I want tools that are fast, lean, and reliable. When building my personal blog and portfolio site, I needed a solution that matched the way I think and work — one that’s developer-friendly, low-maintenance, and future-proof.

After evaluating the landscape, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) — an open-source static site generator — and haven’t looked back.

## Why not a traditional CMS?

Popular platforms like WordPress, Ghost, Medium, or Wix offer convenient interfaces and polished templates. But they come at a cost:

- Hosting fees and plugin lock-in
- Security updates and patch cycles
- Slow loading times without heavy caching
- Database maintenance and migration risk
- Dependency on a live admin dashboard

I didn’t want any of that.

## What I really wanted

I wanted a blog that is:

- 🚀 **Fast** — page loads under 100ms
- 💸 **Cheap to host** — static content deployable on free GitHub Pages
- 🛠 **Minimal to maintain** — no database, no updates, no runtime environment
- 📁 **Markdown-first** — content is portable, editable offline, and version-controlled
- 🌍 **Multilingual** — because I write in both English and French
- 🧩 **Customizable** — I want full control over structure, theme, and behavior

Hugo ticked all those boxes.

## Why Hugo stands out

Unlike other static site generators, Hugo is built with performance and simplicity in mind:

- ⚡ **Blazing fast** — Hugo can generate thousands of pages in milliseconds.
- 🧠 **Go-powered** — written in the Go language, it’s fast and robust.
- 🧱 **Modular structure** — perfect for evolving your site without rebuilding it from scratch.
- 🌐 **Built-in multilingual support** — no plugins needed.
- ✅ **Works perfectly with GitHub Pages** — and integrates easily with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## It aligns with how I build

I treat my blog like code:

- I write in Markdown.
- I version everything with Git.
- I preview locally and deploy automatically via GitHub Actions.
- My content lives in my repo, not in someone else’s database.
- The site loads fast, even with no JavaScript.

Hugo respects my time — no plugins to babysit, no broken updates, no servers to reboot.

## Long-term value

The more I work in tech, the more I value tools that reduce complexity and create leverage. Hugo offers:

- 🧩 **Portability** — Markdown and static assets will still work 10 years from now
- 💰 **Cost control** — hosting is free or nearly free
- 🧘 **Peace of mind** — no attack surface, no updates to break the site
- 🧪 **Developer joy** — everything is text, Git, and logic

I’m not interested in buzzwords — I’m interested in value over time. Hugo is a system that rewards you for keeping things simple.

## In summary

Hugo is not just a blog engine — it’s a platform for thoughtful publishing. Whether you're a developer, writer, or entrepreneur, it's a tool that helps you build fast, low-maintenance websites that scale with your ideas — not your hosting bills.

That’s why I chose Hugo.
